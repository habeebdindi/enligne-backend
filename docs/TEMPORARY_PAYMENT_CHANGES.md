# Temporary Payment Changes - MoMo Integration Paused

## Overview
The MoMo integration has been temporarily paused. Payment processing now works with manual confirmation by administrators.

## Changes Made

### 1. Payment Processing Flow
- **Before**: Payment → MoMo API call → Webhook updates status
- **Now**: Payment → PENDING status → Manual admin confirmation

### 2. Modified Files
- `src/services/payment.service.ts` - Bypassed MoMo API calls
- `src/controllers/payment.controller.ts` - Added admin confirmation endpoint
- `src/routes/payment.routes.ts` - Added admin route and updated documentation

### 3. New Admin Endpoint
```http
PATCH /api/payments/admin/confirm/:paymentId
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

{
  "status": "PAID",  // or "FAILED"
  "reason": "Manual confirmation after verifying payment receipt"
}
```

## How It Works Now

### For Users
1. User creates payment request (same as before)
2. System creates payment record with PENDING status
3. User receives confirmation that payment will be manually verified
4. User receives notification once payment is confirmed by admin

### For Admins
1. View pending payments in the system
2. Verify payment externally (check mobile money statements, etc.)
3. Use admin endpoint to confirm payment:
   - `PAID` - Payment confirmed, order proceeds
   - `FAILED` - Payment failed, order remains unpaid

## Key Features
- ✅ **Phone number validation**: Basic format validation maintained
- ✅ **Payment history**: All existing payment tracking works
- ✅ **Order updates**: Orders automatically update when payments confirmed
- ✅ **Notifications**: Users notified of payment status changes
- ✅ **Audit trail**: All manual confirmations are logged with timestamps

## API Endpoints Status
- ✅ `POST /payments/process` - Creates PENDING payments
- ✅ `GET /payments/verify/:transactionId` - Returns database status
- ✅ `GET /payments/history` - Works normally
- ✅ `GET /payments/stats` - Works normally
- ⚠️ `POST /payments/webhook/momo` - Kept for future use (currently inactive)
- ✅ `PATCH /payments/admin/confirm/:paymentId` - **NEW** Admin confirmation

## Example Usage

### Create Payment (User)
```bash
curl -X POST /api/payments/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "orderId": "order_123",
    "phoneNumber": "+250781234567",
    "paymentMethod": "MOMO_PAY"
  }'
```

### Confirm Payment (Admin)
```bash
curl -X PATCH /api/payments/admin/confirm/payment_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "PAID",
    "reason": "Verified payment in MTN Mobile Money statement"
  }'
```

## Important Notes

1. **Only PENDING payments can be confirmed** - The system prevents confirming already processed payments
2. **Admin role checking** - Currently commented out, should be implemented in production
3. **Audit logging** - All manual confirmations include timestamps and reasons
4. **Reversibility** - Easy to restore MoMo integration by reverting the changes

## Database Impact
- Payment records include additional metadata fields:
  - `requiresManualConfirmation: true`
  - `adminConfirmedAt: timestamp`
  - `adminConfirmedBy: admin_id`
  - `confirmationReason: string`

## Testing
- All existing payment tests should still pass
- New admin endpoint can be tested manually
- Phone number validation works as expected

## When to Restore MoMo Integration
1. Revert changes in `src/services/payment.service.ts`
2. Remove admin confirmation endpoint (or keep as backup)
3. Update documentation to reflect restored integration
4. Test MoMo webhook functionality

**Status**: Active - Manual payment confirmation workflow in use  
**Next Steps**: Monitor system, prepare for MoMo integration restoration
